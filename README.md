**Face Recognition Attendance System**
This repository hosts the Face Recognition Attendance System, an innovative project designed to automate attendance tracking using facial recognition technology. The system leverages Python for backend development, incorporating Haar Cascade for face detection and LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) for face recognition. The project also features a web-based interface for efficient management.

**Features**
Automated Attendance: Eliminates manual attendance processes by recognizing individuals through their facial features.
Accurate Face Detection and Recognition: Utilizes Haar Cascade and LBPH for robust performance in real-world scenarios.
Web Application: Provides a user-friendly interface for managing attendance records seamlessly.
Scalable Design: Can be adapted for diverse environments such as schools, offices, and events.

**Problem Statement**
Traditional methods of attendance tracking are time-consuming, prone to errors, and susceptible to misuse. This system solves these issues by introducing a contactless, efficient, and secure method to manage attendance.

**Solution**
Face Detection: Haar Cascade classifier identifies faces in live or pre-recorded video streams.
Face Recognition: LBPH algorithm ensures accurate recognition, even under varying lighting conditions or facial expressions.
Integration with Web App: A Python-based web application enables administrators to view and manage attendance records effortlessly.

**Tools and Technologies**
Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used: OpenCV, Flask
Algorithms: Haar Cascade, LBPH
